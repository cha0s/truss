## Truss

**See the full documentation at http://cha0s.github.io/truss**

### Hi, what are you?

Truss is an opinionated JavaScript application framework. It is
organized into [packages](packages) which implement
[hooks](hooks), as a means of communicating between each other and
influencing the way the application behaves.

### Hi, why are you?

The intention of Truss is to lay the foundation allowing you to build rich,
powerful applications in an elegant and structured way; without needing to
hack on or change the core codebase. Everything you need should be doable by
creating a new package. If you find the opposite to be true, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/cha0s/truss/issues)!

### Hi, how dare you?

[[Insert deepest condolences for lack of/incomprehensible/otherwise wanting
documentation with vague reassurance that it will someday not be the
case **HERE**]]

### TODO
